        <h1>The Stuff of Nightmares</h1>
      <body>
        <p>You, the player, awaken in a world constructed of your worst nightmares, and the only way to escape is to discover your greatest fear. 
        Far from just whether darkness makes your heart pump or needles make you shiver, this is the fear that festers in the deepest parts of your heart.
        Perhaps you fear your own worthlessness, or that you have no control over your own life, or that the most terrible monster is the one that lurks within you.
        You must uncover the truth of your own fear all while surviving the nighmares and monsters that pursue you.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Player</h2>
        <p>This nondescript figure is you, it is the form you will embody while traversing the nightmare realm.</p>

        <h2>The Other Girl</h2>
        <p>Though sweet enough in her outward appearance, make no mistake, The Other Girl is as empty as the void of space.
        A sentient porcelain doll that cannot be killed and can shatter you, body and mind, with a single touch, taking your appearance and replacing you.</p>

        <h2>The Marionette</h2>
        <p>This puppet may be limited by its strings, but if you're not careful you will be too.
        The Marionette can move surprisingly fast, it can wrap you up in its strings and with a single pull sever your body into a dozen bloddy pieces.</p>

        <h2>The Flashlight</h2>
        <p>There's not a lot of light to be found in this world, so take some where you can get it.
        This flashlight will help guide you through the shadowy halls of the nightmare realm.</p>

        <h2>The Mirror</h2>
        <p>Be careful when gazing into this looking glass, you might not like what you see.
        However, even if you are frightened by the face looking back, it is always your own.</p>

        <h2>Baby Face</h2>
        <p>This head is always hungry, it gnashes its teeth looking for anything to consume.
          If you don't run fast enough you'll end up as its next meal</p>
